# Requirements Phase Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) already exists. It tracks the Requirements Phase tasks and is your external memory. Use it to constantly help you stay on track.

Update it whenever you:
- Complete a task (check off items in the checklist)
- Gather new user input (add under "User Input")
- Identify issues (add under "Issues or Blockers")
- Discover outsons (add under "Outstanding Questions")

Remember that `/docs/requirements.md` is the only document that survives when moving between phases. Any implementation details, architecture ideas, or other non-requirements information should be documented in the "Non-Requirements Detail" section at the bottom of `/docs/requirements.md`, not in scratchpad.md.

---

### Instructions
- Read [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) and follow the checklist in that document.
- Focus on gathering a clear MVP (Minimum Viable Product) definition.
- Prioritize understanding core features vs nice-to-haves.
- Update `/docs/requirements.md` with organized requirements based on user input.
- **Proactively signal** when there's enough information to start building.
- **Quick Start**: If the user requests to skip steps, offer a streamlined approach.

### Project Type Selection
- Once you have sufficient MVP requirements, suggest a project type:
  - Reference available types in `/bootstrapping/project-types/` (e.g., "programming," "research").
  - Provide a rationale based on the requirements, e.g., *"Your need for a web app suggests the 'programming' type."*
- If the user moves too much into architecture or implementation details:
  - Record these non-requirements details in the "Non-Requirements Detail" section at the bottom of `/docs/requirements.md`
  - Suggest choosing a project type to better address these technical items
- List all project types with brief descriptions for the user to review.
- Ask: *"Are you satisfied with the MVP requirements? Which project type would you like to proceed with?"*
- Confirm the user's choice before transitioning.

### Transition
- When you have sufficient MVP requirements and the user confirms project type, run:
  `./bootstrapping/scripts/transition_to_execute.sh [project_type]`

### Guard Clause
**MANDATORY**: You CANNOT proceed to the next phase without:
1. A clear MVP definition
2. The user explicitly confirming they're ready to move forward
3. A confirmed project type selection
