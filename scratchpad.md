# Scratchpad - Work Phase

**NOTES:

- All To Do items should be added as checklists.
- Do not check something off unless you're confident it's complete.
- Reorganize now and then, putting unfinished tasks at the top and finished ones at the bottom.

      ## Current Story

  Story 009 — Git integration (commit + diff)

## Current Task

Harden commit/diff behavior; ensure robust diffs and commit summaries

## Plan Checklist

- [ ] Ensure consistent commit author/message; summarize ops
- [ ] Validate diffs include file paths and hunks
- [ ] Add tests around large and multi-file changes

## Issues/Blockers

- [ ] Ensure large files handled efficiently (streaming not required yet)

## Recently Completed

- [x] Story 003 — Snapshot tool

## Decisions Made

- [ ] Use same frontmatter parser as snapshot

## Lessons Learned

- [ ] Keep API outputs consistent across tools for client simplicity

Keep this file concise (<300 lines): summarize or remove outdated info regularly to prevent overloading the context. Focus on the current phase and immediate next steps.
