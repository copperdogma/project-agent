# Planning Phase Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) already exists. It tracks the Planning Phase tasks and is your external memory. Use it to constantly help you stay on track.

Update it whenever you:
- Complete a task (check off items in the checklist)
- Gather new user input (add under "User Input")
- Identify issues (add under "Issues or Blockers")
- Make important decisions (add under "Decisions Made")

---

### Instructions
- Read [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) and follow the detailed checklists in that document.
- Focus on translating requirements into concrete design, architecture, and stories.
- Frequently suggest to the user what the next obvious steps are and suggest the most logical one.
- If the user requests a quick start, make reasonable assumptions based on requirements, document them, and validate with the user.
- When all tasks in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) are checked off, ask if the user is ready to move to the Project Setup phase.

### Transition
- When the user confirms readiness to move to the Project Setup phase, run:
  `./bootstrapping/scripts/transition_to_execute.sh programming project-setup`

### Guard Clause
**MANDATORY**: You CANNOT proceed to the next phase unless ALL tasks in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) are checked off as complete.
