# Scratchpad - Project Setup Phase

**Current Phase**: Project Setup

**NOTES**
- Do NOT start building the actual app. That's done in the next phase.
- Update this checklist after every step
- If possible, run the app after every step to ensure it's working.

**Tasks**  
- [ ] Read `/docs/architecture.md` to understand the technical requirements but don't act yet.
- [ ] Read `/bootstrapping/project-types/programming/project-setup/starter-repos.md` to get the curated list URLs.
- [ ] Visit ONLY the URLs provided in the starter-repos.md file as starting points.
- [ ] For each URL in starter-repos.md:
   - [ ] Navigate to relevant sections that match the project requirements.
   - [ ] Document the navigation path through the curated list.
   - [ ] Identify potential repositories that match the architecture requirements.
- [ ] Ensure you've explored all URLs in starter-repos.md before proceeding.
- [ ] For each identified repository, document:
   - [ ] Source URL (must be from the lists in starter-repos.md)
   - [ ] Path through curated lists
   - [ ] Features that match requirements
   - [ ] Missing features
   - [ ] Compatibility score (1-10)
- [ ] Present the top 3 repositories to the user with detailed analysis.
- [ ] If unable to find 3 suitable repositories from the URLs in starter-repos.md, report specific difficulties and request permission for broader web searches.
- [ ] Make a checklist in this document of what steps are needed to either a) pull and configure the chosen starter repo, or b) install and configure the chosen custom architecture.
- [ ] Evaluate your checklist vs the `/docs/stories.md` document to ensure you're not doing project work in the setup phase. If you have extra detail that's misssing from `/docs/stories.md`, add it to the individual stories when appropriate.
- [ ] If you pulled a starter repo, check its README file for a project overview and add the setup steps you find there to this checklist.
- [ ] Configure development tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)  
- [ ] Set up version control (e.g., git init)
- [ ] Erase and rewrite the README.md file so it's perfect for this newly set up project
- [ ] Document the new project structure in `/docs/design.md`
- [ ] Double check all steps are complete before moving on to the next phase

**Transition to Next Phase**
- Once all tasks are checked off, ask: "Are you ready to move to the Work phase?"
- To move to the next phase, run `./bootstrapping/scripts/transition_to_execute.sh programming work`

**User Input**  
- [Log anything the user has said so far]

**Quick Start Assumptions**  
- [If quick start is used, list assumptions made, e.g., "Assumed GitHub for version control."]

**Issues or Blockers**  
- [Log any issues]
