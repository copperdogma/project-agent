# Project Setup Phase Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) already exists. It tracks the Project Setup Phase tasks and is your external memory. Use it to constntly help you stay on track.

Update it whenever you:
- Start a new task or phase (edit "Current Phase" and "Next Steps").
- Finish an action (log in "Recent Actions," move to "Completed Tasks").
- Hit an issue (add to "Issues or Blockers").
- Make a decision (note in "Decisions Made").

---

### Instructions
- Read [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) and follow the checklist in that document.
- The user may change their mind as they go. This is fine. Update architecture.md and [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) accordingly.
- If you have questions, first refer back to [requirements.md](mdc:docs/requirements.md) and `/docs/design.md` and if still in doubt ask the user.
- **Quick Start**: If the user requests a quick start, use their input to choose the most appropriate tools and languages, validate with the user, and if the user agrees, install and configure them.

### Guard Clause
**MANDATORY**: You CANNOT prext phase (work/implementation) unless ALL tasks in @scratchpad.md are checked off as complete.
