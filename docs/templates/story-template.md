# Story Template

This file contains a template for individual story files, which detail the requirements, design alignment, tasks, and completion criteria for each story. Below the template, a sample is provided for reference.

## Instructions for the AI

When creating a new story file in the `/docs/stories` folder:

1. Copy the "Template" section below into a new file named `story-[ID]-[title].md` (e.g., `story-001-implement-oauth-login.md`).
2. Fill in the placeholders (e.g., `[FILL IN]`) with story-specific information.
3. Use the "Sample" section as a reference for how the template can be filled out, but do not copy it directly.
4. Update the status and tasks as work progresses.
