# Stories Template

This file contains a template for the `stories.md` document, which serves as an index for all development tasks (stories) in the project. Below the template, a sample is provided for reference.

## Instructions for the AI

When creating the `stories.md` file for a new project:

1. Copy the "Template" section below into the new `stories.md` file in the `/docs` folder.
2. Replace placeholders (e.g., `[PROJECT TITLE]`, `[STORY ID]`) with project-specific information.
3. Use the "Sample" section as a reference, but tailor the content to the specific project.
4. Update the "Story List" section as new stories are added or their statuses change.
