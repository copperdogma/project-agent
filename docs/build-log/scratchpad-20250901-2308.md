# Scratchpad - Work Phase

**NOTES:

- All To Do items should be added as checklists.
- Do not check something off unless you're confident it's complete.
- Reorganize now and then, putting unfinished tasks at the top and finished ones at the bottom.

      ## Current Story

  Story 005 — ApplyOps engine

## Current Task

Implement ApplyOps (append/move/update/delete) with commit+diff, idempotency

## Plan Checklist

- [ ] Implement engine in `src/apply.ts`
- [ ] Register MCP tool `project_apply_ops`
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests

## Issues/Blockers

- [ ] Ensure large files handled efficiently (streaming not required yet)

## Recently Completed

- [x] Story 003 — Snapshot tool

## Decisions Made

- [ ] Use same frontmatter parser as snapshot

## Lessons Learned

- [ ] Keep API outputs consistent across tools for client simplicity

Keep this file concise (<300 lines): summarize or remove outdated info regularly to prevent overloading the context. Focus on the current phase and immediate next steps.
